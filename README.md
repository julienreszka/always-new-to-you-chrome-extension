## Purpose

YouTube's recommendation system is based on your viewing habits, comparing them with similar users to suggest content you might enjoy. However, this can often lead to a repetitive cycle of similar content. The 'New to You' Chrome extension breaks this cycle, always introducing you to new content that you might not have discovered otherwise.
